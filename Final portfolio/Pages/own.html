            Up until now, I have finished 2 games, which can be seen here. Both were made for school projects, but the first was voluntary while the second was for a game development class.

            My first game, Piling Priorities, is honestly the one I'm more proud of. That is, other than the technical aspect. I didn't know how to use classes at the time so many objects shared the same 200 or so lines of code.
            The game was made for a project that was supposed to address a real world issue, and our group chose procrastination and how to overcome it. In our project, we tried to push the technique of splitting a large task into several small ones.
            As a result, the narrative of the game is that you are trying to avoid being fired, and a big load of work is given to the player as several, easy to handle tasks.
            There is also task management, as some tasks are much easier to do than other, and while that method doesn't quite apply to the real world, the idea of choosing what to do first is still prevelent
            I personally, as the game's creator, think the game achieved that goal quite well, and it was my first time finishing a game at all, so I'm quite proud of it. Honestly, it's a lot of fun to try and get a high score.
            I encourage you to give it a try!
