            1. What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?
            <br><br>
            Previously, I had a vague idea of how to use HTML and CSS. I had taken a web development course a few years ago and just finished CSS, but I had forgotten a lot by this course.
            <br><br><br>
            2. Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
            <br><br>
            I built my portfolio up from scratch. I tried using one but the templates provided felt a bit too old for my taste.
            <br><br><br>
            3. What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?
            <br><br>
            The most challenging part was the CSS. It was hard to get everything to look right, and sometimes there would be weird bugs that took some time to fix.
            <br><br><br>
            4. How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?
            <br><br>
            I've realized that web development takes a lot of effort especially for usability and accessibility, and it has made me respect large websites more.
            <br><br><br>
            5. What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
            <br><br>
            I would recommend to not shy away from asking questions, and also to experiment. Understanding a tag or line of code is very important so you can use it flexibly.
